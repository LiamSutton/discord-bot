# discord-bot

This is a simple-ish bot I wrote to help people in my Open University tutor group.

the main purpose is for things such as getting the dates of TMA'S at the press of a command and things such as getting definitions for Jargon-y words
that people that haven't studied a computing subject before might not know or even just for quick reference (users can also add their own definitions for things using the bot!)
